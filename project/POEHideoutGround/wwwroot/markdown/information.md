## History

In Path of Exile patch <a href="https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Harvest">3.11, Harvest League</a>, ground tiles were added to the hideout. These tiles are great, but can be a bit cumbersome to place from the in-game editor. 

The calculator here is to help you place these tiles in the large <a href="https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Celestial_Nebula_Hideout">Celestial Nebula Hideout</a> to fully cover the ground of your hideout.

This tool is able to function because they POE hideout file is written in plain-text, and is actually quite easy to understand and start making minor edits. Thanks to the GGG team for that design!

## Exporting the Hideout File

After you customize your hideout, there is an **[Export]** right near the other hideout editor UI buttons.
