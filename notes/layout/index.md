Inherit the layout component base.

```csharp
@inherits LayoutComponentBase
```


Add the body of the layout

```csharp
<div>
    @Body
</div>
```


Questions.
    What is special about @Body. What other syntax like that exists.
    What are the details of the MainLayout file name, and approriate syntax. What other defaults?
