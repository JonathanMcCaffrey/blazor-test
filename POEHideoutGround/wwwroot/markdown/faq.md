**How do I submit bug reports or request features?** <br/>
You can create an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/JonathanMcCaffrey/poe-hideoutground/issues">project's GitHub page</a> with details of the bug or feature.

**Will hideouts beyond <a href="https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Celestial_Nebula_Hideout">Celestial Nebula Hideout</a> be considered?** <br/>
No. I only briefly checked other hideouts, but the basic ground tool doesn't appear to get good results. z-layer issues. <br/>
Plus the Celestial Nebula Hideout is a pretty unique case, given it doesn't contain "normal" ground. <br/>

If the tool did incorporate more hideouts, it would probably be due to a new feature added to the tool, that fit those hideouts.

**How do I edit the hideout file?** <br/>
Check the <a href="/Information">Information</a> section. Hopefully the content there helps explain the steps and concepts.
